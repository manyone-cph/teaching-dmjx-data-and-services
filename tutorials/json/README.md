# JSON

## Usecase

JSON is a common format for data exchange. It is human readable and easy to parse. It is also supported by many programming languages.

We often use JSON to store data in files in the project, for example configuration files or static data such as the main navigation, tags, etc. that we want to fetch in the build process so we don't have to fetch it on every page load.
