# API

## Usecase

APIs are a way to communicate between different systems. They are used to send and receive data. APIs are used in many different ways, for example to get data from a database, to send data to a server, or to get data from a website.

When we build websites most data is fetched from an API. This can be data from a database, data from a third-party service, or data from a CMS. We want to avoid hardcoding data in the website, because then we have to build the website every time the data changes. Instead we use an API to fetch the data.

When we build APIs we can use different technologies. We can use REST, GraphQL, or other technologies. REST is the most common way to build APIs. It is simple and easy to use. GraphQL is a newer technology that is more flexible than REST. It is used by Facebook, GitHub, and other big companies.

When we build APIs we can use different tools. We can use Postman, MockAPI, or other tools. Postman is a tool to test APIs. MockAPI is a tool to create fake APIs. It is useful when we build websites and the real API is not ready yet.
